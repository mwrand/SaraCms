.Net Based Content Management System

As of 5/29/15 this is a personal project to tie together code I've written at multiple jobs over the past decade or so. At this time I do not see a need for yet another CMS system.  But then again, if I was working in a web development shop right now, I constantly be working on building similar systems to reuse code that my team and I built in order to make our projects more repeatable, consistent (drop a developer perspective), and profitable for the company.

This is my first Github project, and although I don't think I can get many people working on this with me, I might be able to get a few friends to work on it from time to time, and maybe if I'm a lucky a few new developers who are looking for a project that they can contribute to and receive meaningful code reviews, and mentoring on.  But ultimately, I want a large project, a large code base, that I can point prospective employers to, because I love working on large projects with big teams.  Having a large CMS is a great way to show my skills for working at that scale.

And although CMS systems aren't cool and sexy, they are a lot of fun to write and manage, because of all the diverse needs and interactions it requires.
